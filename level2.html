                    <p>Swami Vivekananda born Narendranath Datta was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious 
                        teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction 
                        of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world; and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing 
                        Hinduism to the status of a major world religion. Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament 
                        of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," 
                        before introducing Hinduism to Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper 
                        described him as: “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament”. After great 
                        success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United 
                        States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of 
                        New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco , both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.</p><br>
                    <p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion 
                        and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda 
                        extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in 
                        then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his country men, and found a way to travel to the United 
                        States where he was highly successful. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training 
                        for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, to provide charity, social work and education.
                        Vivekananda was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism 
                        in colonial India. He is regarded as a patriotic saint, and his birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.</p><br>

                        Vivekananda as a wandering monk 3, Gourmohan Mukherjee Street, birthplace of Vivekananda, now converted into a museum and 
                        cultural centre Birth and childhood Statue of Vivekananda at the Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House 
                        and Cultural Centre Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta in a Bengali family in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan 
                        Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.
                        He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the 
                        Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family 
                        and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational 
                        attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.
                        Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as 
                        Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Narendra was mischievous and 
                        restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son 
                        and he has sent me one of his demons".</p>
